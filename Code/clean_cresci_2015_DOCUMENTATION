# Clean Cresci-2015 Dataset

## Overview
This script is designed to clean and preprocess the Cresci-2015 dataset, which consists of Twitter data related to social bots and genuine users. The script performs various data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Dependencies
- pandas: Data manipulation library in Python.
- numpy: Numerical computing library in Python.
- os: Operating system interface for file operations.
- datetime: Library for manipulating dates and times in Python.
- sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: Class for scaling numerical features to a specified range.
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Function for splitting data into training and testing sets.

## Class: clean_cresci_2015
This class contains a method `clean_data` which performs the following steps:

1. **Loading Data**: 
   - The script loads tweet and user data from CSV files located in subdirectories of the base directory specified as `base_directory`.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Selects relevant features from both tweet and user datasets.

3. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converts the 'created_at' column in the users dataset to datetime format.

4. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Fills missing values with zeros for numeric columns in both tweet and user datasets.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculates additional features such as 'account_age_years', 'followers_to_friends_ratio' in the users dataset.
   - Calculates tweet-level features such as 'retweet_ratio' and 'reply_ratio'.

6. **Normalization**:
   - Scales numeric features in both tweet and user datasets to a range between 0 and 1 using Min-Max scaling.

7. **Data Merging**:
   - Merges the tweet and user datasets on the 'user_id' and 'id' columns respectively.

8. **Bot Labeling**:
   - Adds a binary 'bot' label based on the folder name.

9. **Saving Cleaned Data**:
   - Saves the cleaned and processed dataframes as CSV files in a 'clean' subdirectory within each dataset's folder.

## Example Usage:
```python
cleaner = clean_cresci_2015()
cleaner.clean_data(base_directory="../Data/cresci-2015.csv/")
